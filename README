RTC-driven Camera Controller

This sketch drives a time- and noise-sensitive camera-controlling system.

It maintains a set of time windows during which the system is in operation.
It monitors a real-time clock for precision and persistence.  During an open
window, it listens for sustained loud noise on a piezo sensor to trigger the
cameras.  When sufficient noise is heard, it triggers a configurable
series of pulses to any number of cameras.

To use this, you'll need these libraries.  To get them, open your sketch folder in
a terminal window and type these commands:

mkdir -p libraries
cd libraries
git clone git://github.com/maniacbug/RTClib.git 
git clone git://github.com/maniacbug/MemoryFree.git
wget http://www.arduino.cc/playground/uploads/Main/MsTimer2.zip && unzip MsTimer2.zip
