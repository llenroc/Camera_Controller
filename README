RTC-driven Camera Controller

This sketch drives a time- and noise-sensitive camera-controlling system.

It maintains a set of time windows during which the system is in operation.
It monitors a real-time clock for precision and persistence.  During an open
window, it listens for sustained loud noise on a piezo sensor to trigger the
cameras.  When sufficient noise is heard, it triggers a configurable
series of pulses to any number of cameras.
